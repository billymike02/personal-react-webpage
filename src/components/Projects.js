      <p>
        "Rogue Toolkit" is a Blender addon developed to theoretically enhance
        the productivity of 3D artists by automating various time-consuming
        tasks. It offers a range of advanced tools designed to simplify the
        integration of sci-fi effects into Blender scenes, including laser
        beams, flak fields, starfields, and path-following animations for
        spacecraft. By automating these processes, the toolkit aims to reduce
        manual effort and streamline workflow, allowing artists to focus more on
        their creative work.
      </p>
      <h3>Features:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Laser Effects:</strong> Effortlessly add and customize
          high-quality laser effects to enhance your scenes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flak Fields:</strong> Automatically generate realistic
          explosion effects within a specified volume, reducing manual
          adjustment time.
        </li>
        <li>

          backgrounds to enrich space scenes without extensive setup.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Path-Following for Spaceships:</strong> Simplify spacecraft
          animations by allowing them to follow predefined paths efficiently.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Platform:</strong> Developed as a Blender addon using
          Blender's Python API for seamless integration.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technology:</strong> Implemented in Python to work within
          Blenderâ€™s scripting environment.
        </li>
        <li>

      <p>
        Rogue Toolkit aims to provide valuable tools for 3D artists by
        automating complex tasks and improving productivity. Although the
        toolkit is designed to assist artists theoretically, its effectiveness
        and practical adoption are based on its intended functionalities and
        ongoing updates.
      </p>
      <h3>Contributions</h3>
      <p>
        As the sole developer, I managed all aspects of Rogue Toolkit, from
        design and development to implementation. Using Python, I created tools
        that automate various tasks in Blender, enhancing the efficiency of
        artists' workflows. My continuous development efforts ensure the toolkit
        remains robust and functional, aiming to address theoretical
        productivity needs in the field.
