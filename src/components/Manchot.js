            queue songs in a shared playlist. The objective is simple: earn
            points by guessing which friend added each song to the queue.

          <h3>Contributions</h3>
          <p>
            I designed and developed every aspect of Playlist Pursuit. From the
            initial concept and user experience design to the technical
            implementation, I handled it all. This includes integrating
            Spotifyâ€™s API, building the real-time features with Firebase, and
            creating a seamless cross-platform experience using Flutter. My role
            encompassed not only coding but also project management, ensuring
            that the app met all functional requirements and delivered an
            engaging user experience.
